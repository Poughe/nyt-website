## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML and CSS

My learning was to go beyond the mastery of making replicas of websites and to begin making them responsive. This project is one of many I created to get the overall feel on how to successfully make a responsive website from mobile to desktop view. 

## Optimizations

I would love to come back to this project and add more functionality to it and place sizing on the pictures better. Not too much optimization needed as (I think) my code was prety lean, but maybe I will think otherwise in the future. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a ton on the seperation of HTML and CSS to help better focus on content that needs to be on the page and styling to put things in the right spot. Hoping to do more replica sites in the future.
